<hr class="half-width">
<p>Maintainers typically do not have time to respond immediately to
every new issue and comment that is added to their repository. In a more
common scenario, a Maintainer visits their repository and finds several
new issues and pull requests, plus some new comments and changes to
those that were open at the end of their previous visit.</p>
<p>A good first step to take in these circumstances is <em>issue
triage</em>: time spent processing the open issues and figuring out what
should be prioritised, what can be closed, what needs to be brought to
the attention of others in the community (co-Maintainers, Curriculum
Advisors, would-be contributors, Core Team, etc), and so on.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>This triage process is usually made much easier, more efficient, and
more fun when co-Maintainers of a lesson can meet synchronously to work
through issues and pull requests together.</p>
<p>Community members have reported positive experience with short,
regularly scheduled (e.g. monthly) coworking sessions with their
Maintainer team, using screen-sharing and focussed discussion to
distribute tasks and collaboratively determine how to process and
respond to contributions.</p>
<p>It can also be a good opportunity for Maintainers to get to know each
other better, and to share their skills and experience with using Git,
GitHub, and the lesson infrastructure.</p>

<p>The triage process can be improved with effective use of
<em>labels</em> applied to issues. Labels are tags that can be applied
to issues (and pull requests), annotating them according to their
status, type, complexity, etc. When labels are applied to an issue, they
appear next to it in the issue listing for the repository. Clicking on a
label will show you a list of all issues with that label.</p>
<p>When returning to a lesson repository after some time away, labels
applied to old issues can help to remind you of their context, and
labels can be added or updated as you triage the issue list.</p>

<p>Developing a lesson is a project and, like most projects, it consists
of multiple tasks. Keeping track of the list of tasks the team has to
do, their progress on each, prioritising tasks for future development,
sprints and releases, etc., quickly becomes a non-trivial task in
itself. Without a project management tool/framework, it can be hard to
keep track of what’s done, or what needs doing, and particularly
difficult to convey that to others in the team or share the
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Different tools and platforms exist to help you with project planning
and management – for example, <a href="https://www.asana.com" class="external-link">Asana</a>,
<a href="https://www.trello.com" class="external-link">Trello</a>, <a href="https://miro.com/" class="external-link">Miro</a>, GitHub itself, even sticky notes on a
white board. Different tools will work best for different teams of
collaborators, but making sure you use a tool to plan and manage work on
your lesson development project is better than making it up as you go
along.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#milestones"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carpentries lessons are developed in GitHub so it is convenient to
use its features to keep track of different components of the project
and their current status.</p>
<p>GitHub offers two features for task/project management:
<em>Projects</em> and <em>Milestones</em>. Projects offer a more
advanced set of functions and are particularly useful when you need to
work on related tasks spread across multiple repositories. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones" class="external-link">Milestones</a>
are comparatively simple and a great place to start, especially if your
efforts are focused on a single repository. The focus will be on
Milestones in this session but we recommend that you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects" class="external-link">learn
more about Projects</a> if you want to take advantage of the full range
of GitHub’s features for project management.</p>
<p>Milestones are a way of organising issues on your project into
smaller units of work (e.g. deliverables) that have deadlines and the
progress of which needs to be closely tracked (e.g. release management).
They are good for managing time-bound, structured iterations and working
in short sprints on batches of issues, which makes them a great fit for
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/lesson-design.html" class="external-link">the
iterative process of lesson development recommended in Collaborative
Lesson Development Training</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful features of Milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add a title and description to the Milestone,
e.g. <em>“Issues to be addressed before October pilot workshop”</em> or
<em>“Accessibility Enhancement Drive”</em>.</li>
<li>The Milestone represents a subset of issues on your repository,
e.g. the things you want to work on next or a set of issues that share a
theme. Issues are assigned to a Milestone in a similar way to adding a
label.</li>
<li>The Milestone can be given a target completion date.</li>
<li>A progress bar indicates how close you are to completing the
Milestone in terms of the number of completed issues versus the total
number of issues.</li>
<li>The order of issues listed in the Milestone can be adjusted manually
by dragging the issue up and down the list, e.g. to indicate task
priority to yourself and your collaborators.</li>

<p>Sven van der Burg, Research Software Engineer at the Netherlands
eScience Center, describes his group’s approach to piloting and
contributing back to someone else’s lesson in The Carpentries
Incubator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At the <a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/" class="external-link">Netherlands
eScience Center</a> we teach <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/" class="external-link">‘Intermediate
Research Software Development’</a> 2-3 times per year. After every
workshop we have a short meeting to distill the most important
improvements we can make for the next time that we teach. We open issues
for improvements to the lesson material (for example <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/issues/349" class="external-link">issue-349</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/issues/347" class="external-link">issue-347</a>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are not direct maintainers of the lesson, but these issues are
important for us to fix before teaching the next edition of the
workshop, because we don’t want to run into them again. Of course other
users of the lesson would also benefit from the issues being
fixed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Therefore, we organised a one-day sprint in which we gathered
together colleagues from different teams to work on improving the
lesson. By all working together on one day, together in the same room,
we were able to focus and get a lot done in a short amount of time,
while not being distracted by the hundreds of other things we are all
working on. Of course, we contacted the lesson maintainers to make sure
that our efforts would be welcome by opening <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/issues/343" class="external-link">an
issue in their lesson repository</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We used a Microsoft Planner board to organise our work and keep
track of what needs to happen:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</figure>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We bundled our contributions in <a href="https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/python-intermediate-development" class="external-link">a
fork of the lesson from The Carpentries Incubator in our own GitHub
organization</a>. We created pull requests from that fork to a dedicated
branch (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development/tree/sprint-May2024" class="external-link">sprint-May2024</a>)
in the lesson repository. We reviewed each other’s work first before a
final review from the lesson maintainers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In this way, we could adapt the lesson to our own needs and
contribute to the lesson in The Carpentries Incubator in a smooth way
that does not take away focus on other projects of me and my
colleagues.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renata Curty, Research Facilitator for Social Sciences at UCSB,
describes her group’s approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our group uses issues and labels and sets milestones in GitHub to
organize our lesson development work.</em> <em>We also use a spreadsheet
to track higher-level decisions, tasks, and assignees and record ideas
and discussion points in our meeting notes before converting them into
more detailed issues.</em> <em>We have been meeting regularly (weekly or
biweekly) to maintain momentum, which helps us to make small but steady
progress.</em> <em>We are currently working on a modularized version of
the workshop that will allow instructors to choose what to teach based
on the time, cohort needs, and learners’ entry knowledge.</em></p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>It can be helpful to refer to issues and pull requests in
conversations elsewhere in a repository. Every issue and PR has a unique
number (based on the order in which they were created). These numbers
can be used, preceded by <code>#</code>, to reference a given issue or
PR.</p>
<p>Additionally, pull requests (and commit messages) that include
particular phrases will trigger the automatic closure of an issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>“closes”</li>
<li>“fixes”</li>
<li>“resolves”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the above words followed with the <code>#</code> and the
number of an issue, e.g. <em>“fixes #34”</em>, included in the
description of a pull request (the first comment in the PR discussion
thread) will tell GitHub that the issue can be automatically closed if
the pull request is merged.</p>

<p>Reviewing pull requests is one of the most important tasks for a
maintainer. The way you review a pull request, and communicate with the
person who opened it, can have an enormous impact on their motivation to
contribute again. It also sets expectations for them and others about
your priorities and quality standards for the project. When done well,
reviews can be an enjoyable, educational, collaborative experience for
both maintainer and contributor.</p>
<p>GitHub provides several features that can improve your experience as
a reviewer, and make it easier for contributors to follow up on your
review.</p>

<p>A good title and description for a pull request should give the
reviewer an immediate impression of the goal(s) and scope of the changes
it contains. <a href="./collaborating_newcomers.html#guide-contributors-with-issue-and-pull-request-templates">Pull

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The specific changes proposed in a pull request can be viewed in its
<em>Files Changed</em> tab. It is usually most helpful to provide
feedback and ask questions on the lines that have been changed. You can
comment on a particular line by hovering the cursor over it and clicking
the <code>+</code> button on the left-hand side. Comments can be added
on their own, or as part of a <em>Review</em>: a commentary on the pull
request as a whole. When choosing the latter, comments are only
published after the reviewer has finished the whole review. To comment
on a range of lines, click-and-hold the <code>+</code> button for the
first line in the range, drag your cursor down the range, then
release.</p>

<p>As well as adding comments line-by-line, you can also suggest
specific changes, e.g. to fix a typo, suggest improved wording, etc. To
do this, take the same approach to start a comment on a line or range of
lines, then click the “add a suggestion” button (plus/minus symbol
inside a document icon), and edit the source content that appears in the
input box with your suggested improvement. Suggesting specific changes
makes it much easier for contributors to a) understand your suggestions,
and b) implement them. Suggested changes will be commited to the pull
request branch as co-authored by the pull request author and
reviewer.</p>

changes, you can finish your review by clicking the “Review changes” or
“Finish your review” button near the top-right of the screen. This is
the place to add general comments and questions, and to summarise your
review. If nothing else, do not forget to thank the contributor for
taking the time to contribute! Choose one of the three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Comment” - a general comment, with no firm outcome. This option can
be a good choice if you plan to close the pull request after completing
your review.</li>
<li>“Approve” - approve the PR for merging. Some people use this when
suggesting only very minor or optional changes - if you want to do this,
make sure you are explicit about what changes you are suggesting etc
before the PR can be merged</li>
<li>“Request changes” - indicates that changes would be required to the
PR before you would be willing to merge it. It also requires another
review before the changes can be merged if the <code>main</code> branch
has been protected (see branch protection rules below).</li>

will use pull requests and reviews in your development process. Where
quality control and shared ownership is important, teams may prefer for
all changes to pass through pull requests, perhaps even requiring at
least one approving review before changes can be merged. (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches" class="external-link">Branch
protection rules</a> can be set in GitHub to enforce such requirements.)
Other teams prefer less formal process, with pull requests used only
when a team members specifically wants to invite feedback and discussion
on their changes.</p>
<p>However you decide to integrate pull requests into your development
process, we recommend discussing it as a team and making agreements
about how you will work together.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>GitHub provides a useful notification feature for collaborative work
- <em>mentions</em>. The mention system notifies team members when
somebody else references them in an issue, comment or pull request. You
can use mentions to notify people when you want to check a detail with
them, or let them know something has been fixed or changed (this is much
easier than writing out all the same information again in an email!). In
repositories belonging to an <em>organisation</em> rather than an
individual user, <em>Teams</em> of users can be created and mentioned
collectively, sending a notification to all its individual members.</p>
<p>Typing <code>@</code> in GitHub will bring up a list of all accounts
and teams linked to the repository that can be mentioned. You can also
mention people who aren’t linked with the repository, but they won’t be
listed in the <code>@</code> drop-down list so you will need to know
their GitHub username in order to mention them.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="when-will-i-be-notifed">When Will I Be Notifed?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when-will-i-be-notifed"></a>
</h3>
<p>By default, a user will be notified when they are mentioned, assigned
an issue, asked to review something, and when some activity occurs on an
issue or pull request that they opened or commented on previously. These
settings can be adjusted for individual projects via a dropdown on the
landing page of the repository.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/github-watch-settings.png" alt="GitHub's different notification settings menu when watching repository events with 'All Activity' highlighted" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">GitHub’s different notification settings menu
when watching repository events with ‘All Activity’ highlighted</div>
</figure><p>You can choose to ignore a project, meaning that GitHub will never
notify you about activity on that repository even if you are mentioned
directly. Or you might prefer to “watch” the project, receiving updates
on any activity on the repository e.g. whenever somebody opens a new
issue or pull request, or comments on an existing one. There is also the
option to further customise notifications.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="how-will-i-be-notified">How Will I Be Notified?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-will-i-be-notified"></a>

<p>In the settings for your GitHub account, you can also choose where
these notifications will appear. GitHub can send you emails to multiple
addresses or add notifications to <a href="https://github.com/notifications" class="external-link">an “inbox” page</a> in the
GitHub web interface. You can configure where you want different kinds
of notifications to be sent, and even customise these settings from
project to project.</p>

  Managing GitHub Notifications
  </h3>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>If you work on multiple projects, or the projects you follow on
GitHub are particularly active, the volume of notifications you receive
can quickly become overwhelming. Here are some approaches you can take
to help you stay on top of things, and distinguish the high-priority
tasks and important updates from the regular traffic.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="email-notifications">Email Notifications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#email-notifications"></a>
</h5>
<p>If you want to filter, organise, and redirect email notifications
from GitHub, here are some characteristics of the messages that you make
use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>All GitHub notifications are sent from the address
<code>notifications@github.com</code>.</li>
<li>Notification emails are sent to the address
<code>repo-name@noreply.github.com</code>, where <code>repo-name</code>
is the name of the repository where the notification was triggered.</li>
<li>The email subject begins with <code>[org-or-user/repo-name]</code>,
where <code>org-or-user</code> is the name of the organisation or the
username of the user who owns the repository and <code>repo-name</code>
is the name of the repository where the notification was triggered.</li>
<li>In addition to your email address, the cc field of the message
contains an address that describes the type of event that triggered the
notification.
<ul>
<li>
<code>author@noreply.github.com</code> for activity on an issue or
pull request that you opened.</li>
<li>
<code>mention@noreply.github.com</code> for a mention of your
username.</li>
<li>
<code>team-mention@noreply.github.com</code> for a mention of a team
you are a member of.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The email header (metadata) includes a <code>mailing-list</code>
field with an identifier in the form
<code>repo-name.org-or-user.github.com</code>, which can be used to
filter by the project and/or its owner.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#filtering-email-notifications" class="external-link">GitHub
provides detailed documentation about all of the properties you can use
to filter their notification emails</a>.</p>
<p>Most email clients provide configuration for rules that can be set to
redirect messages to particular folders, and/or to annotate them with a
mark or flag, based on this kind of information. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en" class="external-link">Here is the
documentation for setting such rules in Gmail</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="notifications-on-github-com">Notifications on GitHub.com<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notifications-on-github-com"></a>
</h5>
<p>The GitHub notifications inbox page includes several preconfigured
filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group notifications by repository.</li>
<li>Review notifications for a particular repository.</li>
<li>Review particular types of notification e.g. mentions, issue
assignments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create your own, more sophisticated filters, using the
search bar, e.g. all mentions for all repositories in a particular
organisation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whatever strategy you choose, one of the most important habits that
will help you stay on top of your projects and tasks is to remember to
check these notifications frequently.</p>

<p>In addition to tracking and responding to activity on your
repository, effective teams typically maintain other channels of
communication. These channels can be useful for more informal
communication and back-and-forth discussion that is less suitable for a
public discussion thread on GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/" class="external-link">Slack</a> is commonly used in the
Carpentries community for quick, day-to-day message exchange. You should
<a href="https://slack-invite.carpentries.org/" class="external-link">join the Carpentries
Slack workspace</a> to connect with other lesson developers. Once you
join, you can join the <code>lesson-dev</code> channel, which is
dedicated to discussion of lesson development, and create a channel for
your own project under <a href="https://carpentries.slack.com/" class="external-link">the
Carpentries public Slack workspace</a>. If you need more complex team
communications (e.g. multiple channels) you can create your own <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" class="external-link">Slack workspace</a>. Workspaces can
be created for free but carry some restrictions e.g. on message volume
and history, and file storage. The Carpentries Slack is an enterprise
workspace and is not subject to these limits.</p>
<p>Collaborators may also choose other platforms to discuss lesson
development or receive contributions from newcomers who are not yet
fluent in using GitHub’s systems of communication. The Carpentries can
assist with creating a mailing list specific to the development of your
lesson on our <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/" class="external-link">TopicBox</a>
platform for managing threaded email discussions. Also make sure to join
the <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers" class="external-link">Incubator
lesson developers mailing list</a> on TopicBox to keep an eye on
announcements and discussions relating to lesson development within the
Carpentries community.</p>
<p>The exact channels and cadance of your communication will largely
depend on the personal preferences of your team members. The best thing
you can do is devote time in an upcoming meeting/coworking session to
discuss and agree on where and how you will communicate about the
project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="making-progress">Making Progress<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#making-progress"></a>
</h3>
<p>The following practices have been shown to help maintain steady
progress with lesson development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being responsive to notifications about activities and
mentions.</li>
<li>Scheduling regular co-working/<a href="reference.html#glossary">sprinting</a> sessions with team members
(e.g attaching your sprint sessions to other open source community
activities, which may offer goodies, rewards and prizes for
participants, can provide motivation and activity spikes).</li>
<li>Working alongside other members of The Carpentries community at
Maintainer or lesson development co-working sessions.</li>
<li>Blocking time in your calendar for issue triage/solo material
writing.</li>
<li>Planning lesson pilots in advance to help set targets.</li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="document-your-project">Document your project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#document-your-project"></a>
</h3>
<p>One way to make sure you achieve this is to spend time on
‘external-facing’ features, such as documentation, that will make the
project more accessible to newcomers. Such documentation will be useful
to yourself and other team members as well, e.g. if you are trying to
come back to the project after a break or are reusing it for a new
collaboration in the future.</p>
<p>Your lesson documentation should contain the following information,
which should be kept up to date:</p>

<ul>
<li>A structured, up-to-date README. The README, often a
<code>README.md</code> or <code>README.txt</code> file, represents the
first piece of documentation that people will find when they arrive at
your lesson repository. You should aim to capture all the information
that a potential contibutor or user might need to understand what the
project is and how to work with it. Consider including the following
information:
<ul>
<li><strong>lesson title</strong></li>
<li><strong>lesson description</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Information about how to use the project</strong> – This
might be a link to the rendered version of the lesson or to further
documentation, or installation instructions and some examples of
usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>List of current maintainers</strong> – Let people know who
is responsible for the project and how to contact them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Contributing information</strong> – Summarise the kinds of
contributions you are (or are not) seeking and how to get involved,
linking to the repository <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file for more
details.</li>
<li>
<strong>Credits/acknowledgements</strong> – Acknowledging past
maintainers and others who have helped build the project and templates
and resources you have used and adapted gives would-be contributors
confidence that their efforts will be credited too.</li>
<li>
<strong>Citation</strong> – Tell people how they should cite your
project. This could be a summary of the detailed information you provide
in a separate <code>CITATION.cff</code> file (see below).</li>
<li>
<strong>License</strong> – Summarise the licensing terms of the
project, linking to the project’s full license file (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An up-to-date <code>CITATION.cff</code> file. – A file containing
information about the authors of the project, other projects and
resources it is based on or refers to, its license, the DOI of the
latest version, etc, in <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format" class="external-link">Citation
File Format (CFF)</a> (a specialised kind of YAML file). If your lesson
repository contains a <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, GitHub will
automatically show the citation information in the sidebar. CFF is also
recognised and supported by other platforms including <a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" class="external-link">Zotero reference manager</a>.</li>
<li>
<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> – A contributing guide describing how
people can send their contributions, what kinds of contribution will be
credited and in what ways. Carpentries lesson repositories already have
a generic Carpentries <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file to get you
started, which you should review and modify to fit the needs of your
project and team.</li>
<li>
<code>LICENSE.md</code> – A file containing the licensing terms of
the project, including the conditions under which others may re-use,
adapt, and distribute its contents. Without a license other people
cannot use your material at all. Use GitHub’s license choosing tool or
find another pre-existing license that fits your needs (e.g. from
Creative Commons). Do not write your own!</li>

<p>Many potential contributors will “lurk” on an open source project
before making their first contribution and many occasional contributors
are probably paying attention to activity on the repository too. People
often feel intimidated about contributing to a project for the first
time and anything you can do to reduce that barrier and encourage them
to participate will help you grow the community around your project.</p>

<h4 id="be-intentional-about-your-public-communications">Be intentional about your public communications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-intentional-about-your-public-communications"></a>
</h4>
<p>All projects have a culture, much of which will be visible on a
public GitHub repository, whether maintainers try to actively establish
and nurture it or not. Investing time and energy in communicating in a
polite and friendly way, even among a small group of team members who
collaborate with each other all the time, shows newcomers how they can
expect to be received when they make their first contribution. Modeling
respectful behaviour between maintainers demonstrates something
important about the culture of your project to anybody watching (or
looking back at past discussion threads).</p>
<p>Discuss with your team members how you want to work together then
document those norms and work to maintain them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="be-responsive">Be responsive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-responsive"></a>
</h4>
<p>It helps to process and respond to contributions quickly, especially
when somebody is participating in the project for the first time. Longs
delays between opening an issue or pull request and a first response
from a maintainer can be demotivating. Similarly, after waiting a long
time for a response, the contributor may no longer have time to follow
up, having moved on to other tasks and projects.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have <a href="./collaborating_team.html#staying-in-the-loop">configured
notifications for your project</a> so that you will know about it when
somebody gets involved.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="say-no-when-you-need-to">Say <em>“no”</em> when you need to<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#say-no-when-you-need-to"></a>
</h4>
<p>Not every contribution is a good fit for a project and you probably
will not want to accept every suggested change, especially in the later
stages of its development. If you receive a pull request or issue that
does not fit your lesson, consider the following points to help you
politely decline without demotivating the contributor:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Thank them</strong> for taking the time to contribute.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explain why the contribution does not fit</strong> into the
lesson, and offer suggestions for improvement if you’re able to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Link to relevant documentation</strong>, if you have it.
Notes about the design and scope of the project and any relevant
discussion threads can be very helpful here. If you notice similar
repeated requests/contributions, you might want to address them in your
documentation (e.g. in the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file) to save
yourself time in future.</li>
<li>
<strong>Close the request</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advice above is taken from <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/02-communicate-contributors.html" class="external-link">The

sessions for their projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples listed above can be adapted to other project settings:
the important takeaway message is that maintainers should invest time in
outreach, rather than passively hoping for newcomers to spontaneously
appear.</p>
<p>The Carpentries community handbook includes a set of <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-sprint-recommendations.html" class="external-link">recommendations
for organising and running a lesson sprint</a>, most of which applies
equally well to the co-creation of other kinds of (open source)
projects.</p>

</h3>
<p>Long discussion threads with no clear resolution or action steps can
be another barrier for would-be contributors to overcome. One good
technique for maintainers to mitigate this is to periodically summarise
the current state of a discussion, to make it easier for newcomers to
understand what is needed to make progress on a given issue or pull
request. (Other contributors may find this helpful too!) As the context
and details of an issue change and become clearer over time, it can be
similarly helpful to adjust the title and opening comment of the
discussion. Bear in mind that editing an existing comment will not
trigger a notification to those subscribed to the thread in the same way
that a new comment would: you should post a new comment to make sure
that everyone involved is aware of your changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository" class="external-link">Templates
for new issues and pull requests</a> can guide newcomers and experienced
contributors to provide the information you need to be able to process
and respond to their contributions efficiently.</p>
<p>A pull request template specifies Markdown content that will be
present by default in the description box of any new pull request on the
project. Use it to prompt contributors to provide any information that
will help you process and review their proposed changes. Issue templates
can also contain a default description for a new issue or define a more
structured set of prompts for contributors to respond to by templating a
form that contributors must complete to open an issue.</p>
<p>Multiple templates can be specified for issues and pull requests on a
project, providing different guidance for contributors making different
kinds of contributions (e.g. reporting a bug, asking a question,
providing feedback from a pilot workshop, etc).</p>
<p>Issue and pull request templates are kept in the <code>.github</code>
folder of a repository. (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#creating-a-repository-for-default-files" class="external-link">Templates
can also be configured at the organization level</a>.)</p>
<p>Issue form templates are specified with YAML and saved with the
<code>.yml</code> filename extension. GitHub’s web interface has some
built-in checks and syntax highlighting to help you compose them. Pull
request templates and non-form issue templates are written as Markdown
files (<code>.md</code> extension) with metadata such as default labels
and assignee for the resulting issue specified as YAML front matter at
the top of the file. <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/.github" class="external-link">The issue and pull request
templates used in most Carpentries projects</a> could be a good starting
point for your project.</p>
