Curriculum for a 2hr session teaching some of GitHub's features and the skills to use them for more effective (lesson) repository maintenance.

The content is adapted from the existing [GitHub Skill-up for Maintainers and Lesson Developers](https://carpentries.github.io/github-skill-up-maintainers) and some episodes of [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training).

## Target Audience
This skill-up is aimed at Carpentries community members who want to use GitHub’s features to manage their lesson project more effectively. It is suitable for people who are familiar with the folders and files of a Carpentries lesson repository, know how to use GitHub’s web interface to edit the source files of a lesson, and can open and merge pull requests to make changes to the project. By following the session, participants will learn to manage and track issues on their project more effectively, review and provide targeted feedback on proposed changes, coordinate with collaborators to make steady progress on the project, and encourage newcomers to the project to engage as contributors.

## Learning Objectives
After following this skill-up, participants will be able to:

* Manage issues on their repositories with labels and milestones.
* Review contributions and provide constructive, targeted feedback.
* Choose ways to communicate and work with their collaborators to ensure regular progress on the project.
* Document their repository to encourage contributions.
* List three actions they could take to boost the visibility of their project in The Carpentries community.
