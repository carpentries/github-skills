This skill-up teaches some of GitHub's features and the skills for more effective (lesson) repository maintenance.
It is designed primarily as a resource for skill-up leaders, but may also be useful for self-directed learning.
The skill-up is taught with example lesson repositories in GitHub but the principles and skills covered are transferable to other repository hosting systems such as GitLab.

We recommend that skill-up leaders use [the Instructor View](./instructor/index.html) of this lesson.

## Target Audience
This skill-up is aimed at Carpentries community members who want to use GitHub’s features to manage their lesson project more effectively. 

It is suitable for people who:

* Know how to use GitHub’s web interface to edit the source files of a repository.
* Can open and merge pull requests to make changes to the project. 

Familiar with the folders and files of a Carpentries lesson repository will be beneficial but is not essential.

By following the session, participants will learn to 

* Manage and track issues on their project more effectively.
* Review and provide targeted feedback on proposed changes.
* Coordinate with collaborators to make steady progress on the project.
* Encourage newcomers to the project to engage as contributors.
