This skill-up teaches some of GitHub's features and the skills to use them for more effective (lesson) repository maintenance.
It is designed primarily as a resource for skill-up leaders, but may also be useful for self-directed learning.
The skill-up is taught with example lesson repositories in GitHub but the principles and skills covered are transferable to other repository hosting systems such as GitLab.

We recommend that skill-up leaders use [the Instructor View](./instructor/index.html) when visiting the site.
